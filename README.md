# OpenLabTools Mechanical Testing Machine

This is the repository for an open source mechanical testing machine with environmental control. A double glazed enclosure is built using OpenBeam extrusion and clear plastic panels as outlined [here](https://github.com/OpenLabTools/Resources-EnvironmentalChambers). Humidity control is achieved with a reservoir/chamber, ultrasonic mister, fan driven air flow and a servo controlled flap/valve. This is discussed further [here](https://github.com/OpenLabTools/Resources-HumidityControl). Temperature control is achieved using the same fan driven air flow system, resistive heating and multiple DS18B20 digital temperature sensors. This approach and alternatives to it are discussed [here](https://github.com/OpenLabTools/Resources-TemperatureControl).

Documentation for the instrument, including assembly instructions and discussion are [here](docs/00-getting_started.md).

This instrument was created by @rob-eager in 2014-15 as an MEng final year project and is currently being documented. It also has a Github Pages [page](http://openlabtools.github.io/Instruments-MechanicalTester/) under development.
